This app is an online social voting app. In it, a user can vote on who they think will win the Oscars while chatting
and joining groups with other users. They can see specifically what people in a group have voted for, as well as trends
across all users.

Navigating the app:
When first entering the app, the user is presented with a login screen. From there, a user can either register an account,
or log in right away if they already have an account. To register, a user needs a unique email, unique username, and password 
of at least 7 characters (no limits on email or username, but email must be of a valid email form). 
Once signed in, the user sees a welcome screen with 6 buttons: Vote Now, My Votes, Groups, Global Results, Chat, and Sign Out.
Vote Now takes the user to a list of all categories. The user can select a category and be given all nominees for that
category. When viewing the nominees in a category, the category a user has voted for will be highlighted. A user can 
cast or recast a vote by clicking on the nominee.
My Votes displays the nominees the user has already voted for, and the category that that nominee belongs to.
Groups shows a list of all groups that already exist, a search field for all groups, and an option to create a new group. To 
create a group, a user only needs to provide a unique name for the group. Any newly created groups will also appear on the
list. Tapping a group will show all members of the group, with an option to join the group. When viewing group members,
tapping a member will show which nominees they have voted for, and the categories of those nominees.
Global results will show bar graphs for all categories, which will display a count for how many votes a nominee has garnered
across all registered users.
Chat takes the user to a view which shows all chats the user currently has. If no chatting has done yet, the screen appears
empty. There is a button at the top right which allows the user to start a new chat with another user. Once this button is
tapped, all users are shown and the current user can tap another to open a chat.
Sign out returns the user to the login page.

With the exception of the login screen, every previous screen can be returned to with the tap of a button in the top left.
