        // ++++++++ WARNING THREADED +++++++++
        // one thing to note is that the code in the pluses runs on its own thread apparently.
        // so you have to be careful when saving data to global variables because any code after the threaded part
        // when accessing global data may or may not have valid values yet.
        
        // also because this code is threaded, display messages, and other function have to be forced to execute
        // on the main thread. So if you see code wrapped in a function like so "DispatchQueue.main.async{ }", thats what is going on
        // You probably noticed the "DispatchQueue.main.async{} " in previous code before threading that was just to be safe.
        
        
        // also because its thread becareful about this block of code having its own scoped variables.
        // For example: say you have a global variable "G". To use it you need to use self.G in this code block
        // If you just use it like "G = 5", than it could use its own scoped variable instead.

            // response is used by swift to generate message based on what happens when communication with the script,
            // error will contain hopefully an error code/message that swift generates when the connection fails
